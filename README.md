#Research Description
We are students in Intro to Artificial Intelligence at Lane Tech High School, where we’ve been learning the fundamentals of machine learning, data processing, and predictive modeling. This STEM Challenge project spans approximately two months, with key milestones including completing our research phase by late January, importing live FX  data in early February, building our predictive model throughout February, and delivering our final dashboard and presentation by the project deadline in early March.

Our team is developing an AI-powered Volatility Alert Dashboard designed to identify abnormal foreign exchange market volatility in real time and present insights in a clear, accessible format. We chose this challenge because it combines several areas we’re eager to explore: working with live data streams, building predictive models more sophisticated than simple linear regression, and creating a tool with practical applications in financial markets. The FX market’s 24-hour nature and rapid price movements make it an ideal testing ground for real-time anomaly detection. Our goal is to build a system that can recognize unusual volatility patterns as they emerge and alert users before significant market shifts occur, essentially giving everyday users access to the kind of analytical tools typically reserved for professional traders. We’re particularly interested in learning how to balance model accuracy with processing speed, since real-time alerts lose their value if they arrive too late.
